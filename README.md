# Drec-DreamRecorder

This repository was originally based on dreamento (accessed from https://github.com/dreamento/dreamento, mid 2024). 
It has developed into a standalone project for **eeg recording** of the signal captured by a ZMax Headband (by Hypnodyne) and **scoring** the eeg signal using the **yasa** library. Additionally the option to send the scoring to a separate **webhook** is implemented, to allow to control external (audio, visual, ...) impulses or applications.

## requirements
- python 3.11
- libraries:
  - Flask==3.1.0
  - mne==0.23.4
  - pyEDFlib==0.1.38
  - PyQt5==5.15.11
  - pyqtgraph-0.13.7
  - torch==2.5.1
  - yasa==0.6.5

 We did not specifically 'opt for' these versions, they were just the current ones when implementing. May work with future versions of these libraries.

## run from scripts
all the following steps describe the procedure for the windows operating system. On other os the commands may differ slightly.

1. clone the repository

2. create a virtual env (in cmd):
```python -m venv /path/to/wherever/you/want/it/to/live/```
3. activate the venv:
run the activate.bat file from your cmd located at /path/to/venv/Scripts/activate.bat
  
4. make sure pip is upgraded:
```python -m pip install --upgrade pip```
5. install the requirements:
- from requirements.txt located in the repository or
- install the required ones manually 
```python -m pip install -r requirements.txt```
or
```python -m pip install <package==version>```
6. run mainconsole.py from your cmd that has the venv activated
```
python mainconsole.py
```

## usage
make sure **HDServer** from hypnodyne is running. 

## TODO:
- [ ] implement 'offline' version, that allows to score previous recordings
- [ ] when saving save the metadata, e.g. what signals are recorded. This is a program setting, therefore relevant
- [ ] bugfixes
  - [ ] the window opened with show_signal can crashes the app when moved or resized incorrectly
  - [ ] when terminating the program after show_signal was called the program gets stuck. probably has to do with threads -> solution: remove show_signal
